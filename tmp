Good Morning Mike,

I have completed the assignment and uploaded the solution to the following GitHub repository:
https://github.com/astyrisk/sony-headphones

When I first developed the script, I used the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. So, I had to reverse-engineer the URL generation pattern from the JavaScript code as it's dynamically generated. However, I later decided to provide an alternative solution using Selenium. This is because Selenium is a common and effective method for handling dynamic content. So, The repository contains both solutions.

I've provided a detailed explanation of both methods and the rationale behind them in the README file. So, I recommend reviewing the README for a full understanding of both implementations

For my last question, I noticed the provided URL returned results beyond headphones, such as earbud tips. Was this intentional? If so, please let me know, and I can add a filter to exclude them in the code.

I enjoyed working on this project and hope you find the solution interesting. I apologize if the two solutions cause any confusion.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Mohamed Abdelbary
